# Reviewer Selection

Select reviewers by changed surface area and user-requested depth. The orchestrator chooses the reviewer set unless the user explicitly names reviewers or focus areas. Do not run every reviewer by default. Narrow reviewers produce better signal.

## User-directed selection

When the user explicitly requests reviewers or focus areas, honor that request and do not silently add unrelated reviewers. Keep `correctness-regression` only when code changed and it materially protects the requested review. If the requested reviewer is irrelevant to the target, say so and ask whether to run it anyway.

Examples:

- `review security` → run `security-boundary` plus correctness only if code changed.
- `review tests and architecture` → run `test-coverage` and `architecture-simplicity`; add correctness only if needed to evaluate changed behavior.
- `review only docs-dx` → run `docs-dx` only.

## Default set

When the user does not name reviewers, always run:

- `correctness-regression` for code changes.

Skip all code reviewers for docs-only changes unless docs contain executable examples, setup commands, config, or API contracts.

## Conditional reviewers

| Reviewer | Run when |
|---|---|
| `spec-compliance` | PR body, issue, PRD, task, roadmap item, or explicit user intent exists. |
| `standards-conventions` | `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, ADRs, style docs, or strong local conventions exist. |
| `security-boundary` | Auth, authorization, permissions, secrets, shell, filesystem, network, deserialization, uploads, user input, cookies, tokens, privacy data, or path handling changed. |
| `test-coverage` | Behavior changed, tests changed, bug fix lacks regression test, or public contract changed. |
| `silent-failure` | Error handling, fallback, retries, null/default handling, logging, catch blocks, cleanup, cancellation, or background jobs changed. |
| `type-contracts` | Public types, schemas, validation, serialization, APIs, CLI/config contracts, DB migrations, or domain invariants changed. |
| `architecture-simplicity` | Large/risky diff, strict/deep mode, file growth, cross-module seams, abstraction churn, duplicated helpers, or user asks for architecture review. |
| `performance` | Loops, queries, caching, concurrency, payload sizes, rendering, IO, startup, or hot paths changed. |
| `docs-dx` | README, docs, examples, setup, scripts, CLIs, dev tooling, or onboarding changed. |
| `codebase-direction` | `codebase`, `next`, roadmap, or improvement-audit mode. |

## Thinking level

Thinking level controls subagent reasoning budget only. It does not choose reviewers, widen scope, or lower the finding bar.

Accepted values:

- `low`
- `medium`
- `high`
- `xhigh`

Default to each selected reviewer profile's configured thinking level when the user does not specify one.

Use higher thinking as an inline subagent override for harder analysis inside selected reviewers: caller tracing, security boundaries, architectural tradeoffs, and ambiguous spec compliance. Do not add unrelated reviewers just because the user asked for higher thinking.

`strict` is not a thinking level. Treat it as a review focus that selects `architecture-simplicity` and raises the maintainability bar.

## Batch rules

- Run independent reviewers in parallel when available.
- Run later reviewers only when their output can change the final decision.
- Do not launch architecture after a diff is already blocked by a clear P1 unless the user requested strict review.
- Do not re-check linter/formatter/typechecker facts unless tooling is absent or the changed code bypasses tooling.

## Reviewer profiles

Each reviewer is a `pi-subagents` profile. The profile owns the reviewer identity, trigger-facing `description`, system prompt, default thinking level, context mode, and tool defaults. The review run owns the dynamic task: target, context, protocol, allowed commands, and output handling.

Select only relevant profiles:

- [`reviewers/spec-compliance.yaml`](reviewers/spec-compliance.yaml)
- [`reviewers/standards-conventions.yaml`](reviewers/standards-conventions.yaml)
- [`reviewers/security-boundary.yaml`](reviewers/security-boundary.yaml)
- [`reviewers/test-coverage.yaml`](reviewers/test-coverage.yaml)
- [`reviewers/silent-failure.yaml`](reviewers/silent-failure.yaml)
- [`reviewers/type-contracts.yaml`](reviewers/type-contracts.yaml)
- [`reviewers/architecture-simplicity.yaml`](reviewers/architecture-simplicity.yaml)
- [`reviewers/performance.yaml`](reviewers/performance.yaml)
- [`reviewers/docs-dx.yaml`](reviewers/docs-dx.yaml)
