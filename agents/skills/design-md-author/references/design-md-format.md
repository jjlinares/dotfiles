# DESIGN.md Format Reference

## Canonical Structure

Use this skeleton:

```markdown
---
version: alpha
name: Brand-design-analysis
description: One dense paragraph describing the recognizable visual language.

colors:
  primary: "#000000"

typography:
  display-xl:
    fontFamily: "Font, system-ui, sans-serif"
    fontSize: 64px
    fontWeight: 600
    lineHeight: 1.0
    letterSpacing: -2px

rounded:
  sm: 4px

spacing:
  sm: 8px

components:
  button-primary:
    backgroundColor: "{colors.primary}"
    textColor: "{colors.on-primary}"
    typography: "{typography.button-md}"
    rounded: "{rounded.pill}"
    padding: "{spacing.sm} {spacing.md}"

## Frontmatter Rules

Keep frontmatter tokenized and reusable:
- `version`: usually `alpha`.
- `name`: source name plus `design-analysis`.
- `description`: single paragraph, 2–4 sentences, high-density visual summary.
- `colors`: semantic roles with exact hex values.
- `typography`: complete type tokens with family, size, weight, line height, letter spacing.
- `rounded`: radius scale from none/small to pill/full.
- `spacing`: practical spacing scale.
- `components`: reusable UI recipes that reference token groups.

Prefer token references over repeated raw values inside `components`.

## Markdown Section Requirements

### Overview
Summarize the brand's design posture. Name the strongest visual signatures: canvas color, type attitude, accent use, density, shape, image treatment, motion/depth if relevant.

### Colors
Group by role: Brand & Accent, Surface, Text, Semantic, Gradient if applicable. For every color, include token name, hex, and usage. Avoid dumping swatches with no role.

### Typography
Document font families, hierarchy table, principles, and substitutes. Include use cases for each token. State casing, tracking, weight limits, and where mono/serif/display faces belong.

### Layout
Document base spacing unit, section padding, grid/container width, column patterns, whitespace philosophy, and density rules.

### Elevation & Depth
Define shadow/border levels and where each appears. If the brand is flat, say so and define the flatness as a rule.

### Shapes
Document radius scale, pill behavior, image/card geometry, icon container shape, avatar shape, and any sharp-corner exceptions.

### Components
Describe buttons, cards, inputs/forms, navigation, chips/tags, modals, tables, and signature brand-specific components. Include states when visible.

### Do's and Don'ts
Write specific guardrails. Bad: "Do make it clean." Good: "Do use one electric-blue CTA per viewport; don't add purple gradients or rounded glassmorphism cards."

### Responsive Behavior
Provide breakpoint table and collapse rules. Cover nav, hero, grids/cards, images, and touch targets.

### Iteration Guide
Give concrete prompts an agent can use to build in the style. Include quick rules for extending pages without breaking the language.

### Known Gaps
List uncertain values, inaccessible proprietary fonts, missing states, untested breakpoints, and estimated tokens.

## Extraction Checklist

Before writing, inspect:
- Homepage hero, nav, footer.
- Product/feature page cards.
- Pricing or form page if available.
- Mobile viewport.
- Hover/focus states if possible.
- CSS variables and loaded font files.
- Repeated motifs: gradients, lines, photography, illustrations, icons, grids.

## Writing Rules

Write like a design engineer, not a marketer:
- Use exact values.
- Use token references.
- Explain where each choice appears.
- State prohibitions.
- Separate evidence from inference.
- Keep prose dense and useful.

Avoid:
- Generic adjectives without implementation meaning.
- Invented colors unsupported by evidence.
- Huge exhaustive CSS dumps.
- Components with no states or usage.
- Brand worship. Extract the system; don't advertise it.
