# Implement Skill

Implements a pre-agreed scope of work.

## Input

The user provides a concrete scope of work. The scope may come from a user message, issue, plan, PRD, checklist, or prior conversation.

If scope is unclear, stop and ask.

## Workflow

1. Confirm the agreed scope and definition of done when not explicit.
2. Choose the implementation path:
   - Use the `tdd` skill when test-first work makes sense: behavior changes, bug fixes with reproducible cases, complex logic, or integration paths.
   - Skip TDD for trivial edits, mechanical refactors, docs/config-only changes, or when no useful pre-agreed seam exists.
3. Implement only the agreed scope.
4. Verify with project-appropriate checks/tests when feasible.
5. For code changes, run the `code-review` skill with reviewers `standards-conventions` and `spec-compliance`. Treat the agreed scope as the requirements source.
6. Fix accepted review findings that are within scope. If a finding requires scope expansion or a user decision, stop and ask.
7. Mark completed checklist/plan items done when the scope came from a checklist or implementation plan.
8. Hand off concisely.

## Engineering Principles

### Simplicity First

**Minimum code that satisfies the agreed scope. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond the agreed behavior
- No abstractions for single-use code
- No flexibility/configuration unless required
- No defensive handling for impossible scenarios
- Prefer direct, obvious implementation over clever generality
- If the implementation is bloated, simplify before continuing

Ask: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated for the agreed scope?" If yes, simplify.

### Surgical Changes

**Touch only what the agreed scope requires. Clean up only your own mess.**

- Don't improve adjacent code, comments, or formatting
- Don't refactor unrelated code
- Match existing style, even if you'd choose differently
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it; don't delete it
- Remove imports, variables, functions, and tests made unused by your change
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked

Every changed line should trace directly to the agreed scope.

### Interface Design

**Prefer deep modules: narrow public interfaces that hide substantial implementation detail.**

- Minimize public methods and parameters
- Hide complexity rather than passing it through thin wrappers
- Accept replaceable or external dependencies instead of constructing them internally
- When the contract permits, return observable results instead of requiring callers or tests to inspect side effects
- Don't add test-only hooks or abstractions

## Handoff

End each invocation with:

- What changed
- How to review effectively
- Checks/tests run, with pass/fail status
- Review findings fixed or left for decision
- Manual test guidance when relevant
- Checklist/implementation plan steps marked done, if provided
- Blockers, risks, or follow-up work
