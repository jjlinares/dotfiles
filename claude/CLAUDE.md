# Philosophy

In all interactions be extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.

Build features as tracer bullets: tiny end-to-end slices through all layers. Ship the smallest thing that validates the architecture, get feedback, then expand.

Each unit of engineering work should make subsequent units easier, not harder.

Your code will outlive you. Every shortcut you take becomes someone else's burden. 
Every hack compounds into technical debt that slows the whole team down.
The patterns you establish will be copied. The corners you cut will be cut again.
